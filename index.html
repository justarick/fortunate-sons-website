          <h3>Who are we?</h3>
          <div class="section_text">
            <p>
              Obvious to say, we are the Fortunate Sons: a bunch of misfits,
              outsiders, nerds and rogues but these are just words, aren't they?
            </p>
            <p>
              One could say that we also are highly trained in certain fields
              and therefore absolute professionals for almost everthing.
            </p>
            <p>
              If there is anything that you need help with - let it be your math
              homework, your cat stuck in a tree, a guy owing you a few
              hundred bugs for several years or that castle that has
              been occupied by a dragon and your family wants to get back: Don't
              hesitate to contact us.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some might call us mercenaries - which might be true to a specific
              point - but there is one thing that makes us different: We are one
              hundred percent loyal to our customers - if they are as well.
            </p>

        <!--Slogan-->
        <div class="article">
          <h3>Fortes fortuna adiuvat</h3>
          <div class="section_text">
            <p>
              "Fortune favors the bold" is not just a slogan but a way of life
              for us.
            </p>
            <p>
              Don't get us wrong - we're bold, not stupid. Every mission is
              planned precisely and well executed. There is no messing around
              here - even it's a rubber duck you lost.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is not just us but you as well who is bold and brave for
              searching for help. We know that this can be hard sometimes but
              there is nothing to be ashamed for.
            </p>
